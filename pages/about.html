          Hi, I&#39;m Cole Pergerson and I am currently practicing to become a game designer. I enjoy creating video games with others, which is why I want to spend most of life doing just that. Many
          of my past highlights include working long hours with friends to finish a game in time for a deadline. In the industry, I like to learn about other studios and how they make their own games. 
          I enjoy meeting new developers and learning about their day-in-a-life as a game developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&#39;m typically a programmer when working with others, but my favorite part is when I get to mess with numbers to create a balanced and satisfying game experience. That might sound boring
          compared to gameplay programmer or concept artist, but simple numbers such as attack speed, enemy damage, or xp progression rate can have a huge impact on the gameplay. I tend think both
          logically and artistically, so tweaking numbers using math to create a subjective experience fits my personality well.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I am not making games, I am usually playing games, drawing, riding a bike, or learning Japanese. My interest in games is very broad, but I typically enjoy dark and moody games at night
          after a long day of work. I can sink hours into strategy games, and a favorite I enjoy with friends is Age of Empires 2. I do like FPS games, but mostly when I play with friends,
          especially if I am fighting them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think great people are good at many things but a master of one. So while I put a significant focus into game design, I try to find other low energy creative outlets. Drawing is enjoyable
          for me and I&#39;ll draw anything that is on my mind. If I&#39;m tired, I must just put on a movie and draw cubes until I fill up a page. I&#39;ll spend time on the internet looking at other
          art such as photography, graphic design, and digital paintings. If I expose myself to different ideas and artistic adventures, I know it will improve my own ability to design interesting
          games.
        </p>
        <p>
          I graduated San Jose State University in 2021 with a degree in Digital Media Art. My greatest highlight of college was being part of the Game Development Club. It was there where I decided
          that I want to make games for the rest of my life. Some of the notable achievements that I accomplished during my time are: ran the Summer Game Dev Workshop for 2 years, hosted Global Game
          Jam in 2021, got elected as Treasurer, hosted game design talks, built Knowledge Base (a resource database), and met some cool friends.
