          <p>
            Hidden Fear is a design concept for a top-down shooter horror game set in a far away galaxy where you must
            replace your body with cybernetic components to become strong enough to escape an alien infested mega
            factor. Fight against hordes of aliens while scavenging resources to upgrade your character to progress
            through the levels and uncover the secrets of the factory.

          <h2>Gameplay of Hidden Fear</h2>
          <p>
            Hidden Fear is a concept for a top-down 2D horde shooter with horror elements. The player would be shooting
            their way through huge masses of aliens while completing mission objectives. Players can run and dodge to
            avoid getting hit and slowed down by aliens. Players have limited ammo so they&#39ll need to look for ammo
            sources as they explore the level while avoiding wasteful shots. Among the simple aliens, there will be
            special aliens that will challenge a certain skill or break the flow.
          </p>
          <p>
            After finishing a mission, the player can use any parts they scavenged to invest into character or weapon
            upgrades. There will be a story between the main character and a sentient AI system that operates the
            factory the player is trapped in. There will be times where player can make choices in dialogue or in which
            mission they select that affect the story.

          <h2>Inspiration</h2>
          <p>
            At the time I was playing Aliens: Fireteam Elite and Vertmintide 2 and I had an idea to turn those
            multiplayer experiences into a singleplayer one. I began to wondered how would the design change without
            multiplayer. The two biggest motivations for those co-op games, competition and social play, would be
            missing so couldn&#39t just couldn&#39t make a 1-to-1 translation. There were many directions I could have
            taken, but adding a strong character progression system and interactive story seemed exciting.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="section-5" id="section-5">
          <h2>Character Progression</h2>
          <p>
            I usually like to start out by outlining the important variables I want to have access to in the code.
          </p>
          <img src="hiddenfear_02.png" alt="placeholder" width="100%" />
          <p>
            Here are all the upgrades I came up with. In the story, I wanted to the character to have to replace their
            organic body with cybernetic parts just to be powerful enough to escape. These cybernetic upgrades would
            improve gameplay stats tied to the character while also being a central part of the character gradual change
            to a cyborg. It was an idea that marriage story with gameplay.
          </p>
          <p>
            With legs and arms being an exception, I didn&#39t use numbers lower than 10%. Anything lower than that
            would feel like a rip-off and their effects would likely not be felt. Each upgrade increase a certain stat
            and the player&#39s power rating.
          </p>
          <img src="hiddenfear_03.png" alt="placeholder" width="100%" />
          <p>
            An automatic leveling up system didn&#39t make sense for Hidden Fear, so instead the player purchases
            character and weapon upgrades that increases a power rating (PR). The higher the PR, the more damage they
            deal. Originally I had an upgrade that increased damage, but I figured players would always get that one, so
            I gave the damage boost for free as a reward for investing in to their PR.
          </p>
          <img src="hiddenfear_04.png" alt="placeholder" width="100%" />
          <p>
            There are 10 different weapons that the player can experiment with. Most weapons use different ammo types to
            encourage the player to try all the weapons. I knew these numbers needed to be tested and would likely need
            to be changed, but I charted them anyways as a starting point. Anyone looking at this chart will have an
            idea of how the weapons are differentiated from another.

          <h2>Mission Difficulty</h2>
          <p>
            This was the most difficult part of the design concept that I never fully completed. Like in Aliens:
            Fireteam elite and Vermintide 2, I wanted a way to rank mission difficulty with a number. In this case, I
            wanted to assign each mission a power rating recommendation, but what dictates that value?
          </p>
          <p>
            I knew there were two broad sets of values that needed to be to be considered. First was the general
            difficulty of the aliens which could be measured by alien count and individual damage and health. Second was
            the player&#39s current upgrades and weapon load out, which determines health, damage, speed, and accuracy.
            I assumed both of these value sets would need to be incorporated into the PR recommendation calculations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sadly, I couldn&#39t figure out to mathematically set PR recommendations for each missions. There were too
            many variables to consider and I didn&#39t know how to even begin. In the google sheets, you can see my
            attempts.

          <h2>Alien Types</h2>
          <p>
            Each special alien challenges a different skill or tries to force the player to change their play style. The
            alien is the simplest enemy that is dangerous in numbers. I want these aliens be statisfying to kill in
            large numbers so that the player feels like a bad-ass. Leaches are aliens that don't move and penalize the
            player for stepping on them. Chargers will unexpectedly burst out of no where and sprint to the player.
            Spitters try to blind the player and reduce fire accuracy. Big Aliens are tanks that have high health and
            damage but are slow to move

          <h2>Was It Fun?</h2>
          <p>
            It's hard to say since there is no game to actually play, there still more work to do before this game could
            ever be greenlit. I started thinking that this design concept would be easy to create, and while it was
            simple to setup, managing the relationships between the variables turned out to exponentially difficult. I
            also realized that I need learn how to make my google sheets more pretty
