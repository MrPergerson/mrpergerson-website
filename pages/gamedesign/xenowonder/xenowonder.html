                Xeno-Wonder is a resource management strategy game where you play as an ancient alien UFO building a pyramid wonder. The game was made over the course of 3 weeks during GitHubâ€™s *Game Off 2022* game jam with a team of 3 game developers.

                **Made by**<br>
                Sound & Music: Miles Caraker<br>
                Art: Alec Chou<br>
                Game Design & Programming: Cole Pergerson
            </p>
            <h3>Tools</h3>
            <p>
                The game was developed using Unity game engine<br>
                C# for programming<br>
                Maya and Photoshop for art production<br>
                Google sheets for game design<br>
                Sounds were made in __?__ and imported into Unity<br>
                Assets were managed and shared across the team using Github

            <h2>Brainstorming</h2>
            <p>
                We came up with two ideas, an ancient aliens inspired strategy game, or a physical based puzzle game where you play as common game ideas, like an explosive barrel. Through a vote, we settled on the first idea and began sketching. 
            </p>
            <img src="../../image_placeholder.png" alt="placeholder" width="100%" />
            <p>Here is an early blender sketch to visual what we were imagining. Besides the camera angle, the sketch closely resembles what the final game ended up looking like.</p>
            <p>
                We had the following requirements for the game<br>
                - UFO has a fixed height and can move in 8 directions<br>
                - Most objects can be picked up and drop.<br>
                - When two objects are put together, they will combine into a new object.<br>
                - If the pyramid build progress is set to 100%, the player wins the game.<br>
                - If the pyramid build progress is set to 0%, the player loses.<br>
                - When barbarians combine with the pyramid, build progress depletes.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                To generate ideas, we used a matrix to list all of the possible combinations. We had a fun imagining how this game could play out as a simple civilization-like game. To simply the scope, we chose the most important objects to the game experience to prioritize, those being: people, rock, brick, pyramid, and barbarian.
            </p>
            <p>We knew early on that the people object was going to be the most important resource of the game. It would be used to generate rock, the resource necessary to win, as well to defeat barbarians, who would deplete the build progress if the reached the pyramid, and lastly, the only way to make people was to combine people together. Se envisioned the player having to make tough decisions when faced with a limited supply of people and a horde of barbarians.</p>
