            Grungeon is a highly-mobile platformer with rewarding jump mechanics
            designed to make your trip through the procedurally-generated level
            as fluid as possible. Use the Friendly Ghosts, or the less friendly
            Ogres and Goblins, as stepping stones to reach overhangs, or
            purchase a limited-use jetpack from the Wizard.

            <h3>Primary actions</h3>
            <p>
              Moving: Use &#39;A&#39; or &#39;D&#39; to move left or right<br />Jumping:
              Press &#39;Space&#39; to jump in the air
            </p>
            <h3>Secondary actions</h3>
            <p>
              Interact: Press &#39;E&#39; to interact with the shop keeper.<br />Buying:
              Once at a shop, you can buy items using gold.<br />Splint: Press
              &#39;Q&#39; to use the splint item.
            </p>
            <h3>Objects</h3>
            <p>
              Walls: Can be used to jump off of.<br />Ghosts: Like walls, you can
              jump off of the ghosts.<br />Orcs: Fast and hart hitting goblins that
              will chase you. If the orc falls towards the player from the air, it
              will do a ground pound, which does extra damage.<br />Flying Goblins:
              Goblins that fly around and ignore level collisions. You can jump off
              of these as well.<br />Dungeon door: A door that must be found and
              unlocked with a key to escape.<br />Key: Can be collected to unlock
              the door.<br />Gold: Collected from killing enemies.<br />Splint:
              Heals broken bones (health).<br />Armor: Gives the player extra
              protection against enemies.<br />Jump pack: Allows for vertical travel
              at any height. Has limited fuel.

            <h2>Level Design</h2>
            <p>
              The goal of the game is to find the dungeon door and key so you can
              escape. Every level is procedurally generated so there will always be
              a different layout. The procedural generation generates a flat ground
              at the bottom where the player will spawn. From there, three pathways
              are created: one that leads to the door, one that leads to the key,
              and one that leads to a dead end. We added one with a dead end so that
              the player is, initially, uncertain about what the pathways lead to.
              This puts the player in an explorer mindset as they jump around the
              level. Since the primary action is jumping, the levels are made up of
              vertical passage ways, but we used some open spaces and horizontal
              passage ways to break up repetition. Sometimes the generation creates
              an area that is impossible to jump so to avoid the player getting
              stuck, ghosts where added as a simple fix. They spawn in open spaces
              as an extra jumping platform.

            <h2>Enemy Design</h2>
            <p>
              There were still times when the player would get stuck, so the flying
              goblins were introduced as a enemy that could be in any position and
              be jumped off of. The flying goblin can travel through walls and
              floors so it is usually always present. If the player is careful to
              not get hit by the goblin, they can use the goblin as a jumping
              platform. The orc was added as an enemy that would spawn above you and
              fall down. Since the player spends most of the time jumping upwards,
              the player needs to be on guard for orcs.
