            Algae Bandit is a game about being a rogue crab who has chosen to
            steal food from other crabs. As the player, you get to choose how
            you want to steal food from crabs, by either using stealth or
            beating up any crab in the way. This game was developed during the
            summer of 2020 and was part of the Game Dev Best Practices Workshop,
            which was hosted by the Game Dev Club at SJSU.

            <h2>Mechanics</h2>
            <p>
              Moving<br />
              The player can use WASD to navigate the level. The movement mimics the
              locomotion of crabs so sideways movement is faster and moving forwards
              or backwards is slower.
              <br /><br />
              Attacking<br />
              The player can attack using either the left or right arm of the crab.
              J is tied to the left arm and K is for the right arm.
              <br /><br />
              Blocking<br />
              If J and K are pressed, then the player can block any incoming attacks
              coming from the front of the crab. Blocking doesn't protect the player
              from the side or behind the crab. Blocking depletes stamina, which
              regains slowly when not blocking. If there is no stamina, then the
              player can not block.
              <br /><br />
              Collecting<br />
              Throughout the level, there are algae that can be collected. To
              collect algae, the player just needs to collide with the algae, which
              will reduce the remaining algae in the level count.

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>
              The core gameplay loop of the game is collecting algae that is guarded
              by other crabs. The goal of the game is to collect all the algae in
              the level. The player can navigate to each algae but they must be
              tactical when thinking about how they will approach another crab. When
              the player approaches a crab, they must be careful to not expose their
              back because it’s defenseless. The player can block attacks in front
              of them but they have limited block stamina.

            <h2>Level Design</h2>
            <p>
              I designed all the levels in the game. My design process started with
          creating some interesting pathways. I would create different layouts
          in Unity until I found one that could possibly create some unique
          challenges for the player. Once the layout was finished, I would try
          to predict the player’s pathway and create challenges along the way.
          If I felt that the pathways to each piece of algae was too easy, I
          would set more challenges for the player. Once done, I would test the
          level and repeat the process until I was happy with it.

            <h2>Concept and Design Decisions</h2>
            <p>
              The idea of the game was inspired by the Lybia edmondsoni crab, also
              known as the boxer crab. It is a small crab that has stinging sea
              anemone on its claws. The anemone resembles boxing gloves and it is
              quite humorous when the crab is fighting another fish or crab. The
              unconventional movement was based on the movement of the crab. This
              was a decision that took about a month of prototyping different ideas
              of movement. We were set on the crab-like movement earlier on but it
              took awhile to figure out how we should orientate the camera and make
              the controls as initiative as possible. Typically to move, games use
              arrow or WASD keys to move. Since we wanted the player to move left
              and right more than up and down, we decided to rotate the crab by 90
              degrees. This allowed the players movement input to match the
              direction of the crab while also keeping the crab moving primary
              sideways.
