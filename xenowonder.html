          <p>
            Xeno-Wonder is a resource management strategy game where you play as an ancient alien UFO building a pyramid
            wonder. The game was made over the course of 3 weeks during GitHub&#39s <i>Game Off 2022</i> game jam with a
            team of 3 game developers.

          <h2>Brainstorming</h2>
          <p>
            We came up with two ideas, an ancient aliens inspired strategy game, or a physical based puzzle game where
            you play as common game ideas, like an explosive barrel. Through a vote, we settled on the first idea and
            began sketching.
          </p>
          <img src="pages/gamedesign/xenowonder/xenowonder00.png" alt="placeholder" width="100%" />
          <p>Here is an early blender sketch to visual what we were imagining. Besides the camera angle, the sketch
            closely resembles what the final game ended up looking like.</p>
          <p>
            We had the following requirements for the game<br>
            - UFO has a fixed height and can move in 8 directions<br>
            - Most objects can be picked up and drop.<br>
            - When two objects are put together, they will combine into a new object.<br>
            - If the pyramid build progress is set to 100%, the player wins the game.<br>
            - If the pyramid build progress is set to 0%, the player loses.<br>
            - When barbarians combine with the pyramid, build progress depletes.<br>
          </p>
          <img src="pages/gamedesign/xenowonder/xenowonder_brainstorming_01.png" alt="placeholder" width="100%" />
          <p>
            To generate ideas, we used a matrix to list all of the possible combinations. We had a fun imagining how
            this game could play out as a simple civilization-like game. To simply the scope, we chose the most
            important objects to the game experience to prioritize, those being: people, rock, brick, pyramid, and
            barbarian.
          </p>
          <p>We knew early on that the people object was going to be the most important resource of the game. It would
            be used to generate rock, the resource necessary to win, as well to defeat barbarians, who would deplete the
            build progress if the reached the pyramid, and lastly, the only way to make people was to combine people
            together. Se envisioned the player having to make tough decisions when faced with a limited supply of people
            and a horde of barbarians.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="section-4" id="section-4">
          <h2>Dialing in the MVP</h2>
          <img src="pages/gamedesign/xenowonder/xenowonder_brainstorming_02.png" alt="placeholder" width="100%" />
          <p>
            Priority Verbs<br>
            - Combine: Two object are placed together and an output is created after X time<br>
            - Destroy: Tileobject is removed from the game<br>
            - Damage: The health or value of a Tileobject is reduced<br>
            - Production Boost: The combination rate of a Tileobject is increased<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            With a limited supply and increasing pressure of barbarians, players would need to efficiently manage the
            combinations of their people. Using all of your people to make rock would greatly increase the build
            progress, but will later expose you to hordes of barbarians. Just focusing on barbarians, however, would not
            be beneficial in the long run since their spawn rate would increase over time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Damage and Production Boost were later cut to make the game simpler to understand. In all but the
            people-with-people combination, the two input Tileobjects were destroyed to create a new TileObject. This
            expectation was broken whenever the damage verb was used, since input Tileobjects could still live after
            combining if their health was greater than zero. The production boost verb was cut since the role of the
            city changed over the course of production and no longer had a use.
          </p>

          <h2>Iteration</h2>
          <p>Here is a image that was taken after the first wave of art assets were imported. The grid was made using
            Unity&#39;s shader graph. People and barbarian objects were not yet implemented (the artist thought the
            blocks outs were fine lol).</p>
          <img src="pages/gamedesign/xenowonder/xenowonder03.png" alt="placeholder" width="100%" />
          <p>First iteration of people and barbarians were added shortly after. While the people models were fine, the
            barbarian models did not look like barbarians. The rocks became thinner so that the brick could stand out
            more post combination. During this version, rocks depleted in value after combination, so the brick tile
            object would sit on top of the rock. In the final version, rocks were always destroyed post combination.
            Dune models were added to act borders while also immersion the player into the desert.</p>
          <img src="pages/gamedesign/xenowonder/xenowonder05.png" alt="placeholder" width="100%" />
          <p>To convey to the player that the pyramid was really being build, different phases of constructions were
            implemented. </p>
            <img src="pages/gamedesign/xenowonder/xenowonder07.png" alt="placeholder" width="100%" />
            <p>The second iteration of barbarian and people were added. These were much more detailed and had their own
            animations. All animations were downloaded from Mixamo.</p>
          <p>Before this point, the lighting was too basic and made any combination of colors look bland. This was only
            because the directional light was pointing directly down so that the UFO shadow acted as a marker. After the
            sun angle was changed, colors were updated, and post-processing was improved, the game looked so much
            better.</p>
          <div class="note">Cole - Now I realize it, the game looks like it&#39;s set the planet of Arrakis from the DUNE
            movie. I made the colors and lighting too dark…too cinematic. The game would of benefitted from a brighter
            and vibrant look. Well that&#39;s what happens when I am in charge of colors…</div>
            <img src="pages/gamedesign/xenowonder/xeno-wonder_012_0000.jpg" alt="placeholder" width="100%" />
            <p>A marker was added so that player will know what is below the UFO. When the UFO picked up any tileobject, a
              cool tractor beam effect played. </p>
              <img src="pages/gamedesign/xenowonder/xeno-wonder_016_0000.jpg" alt="placeholder" width="100%" />
            <p>To better convey the mechanics of the combinations, a timer and outcome icon was implemented. The timer
              appears when a combination starts and represents the amount of time left before the combination ends. When
              the combination ends, an icon appears indicating the outcome to the player.</p>

          <h2>Balancing The Game</h2>
          <p>One thing to be proud of is the fact that this game offers players a challenging experience and many more
            minutes of replay-ability just with a few simple mechanics. There is an elegance to keeping design simple,
            however deep down, there is a feeling that the game needs more. What else could be added, changed, or
            evolved? It is clear that the design is not yet complete but the missing ingredients are some where out
            there, waiting to be discovered.</p>

          <h3>Strategy</h3>
          <p>When the MVP was finished, all the variables were arbitrary set for testing purposes. As a result, the game
            was very difficult to beat and the pacing was too fast to think. Over the course of 2 weeks, many of the
            variables in the GameRules script were increased or decreased until a sweet spot was found. A good practice
            that was followed was Sid Meier&#39s advice that, when balancing a game, values should be either doubled or
            halved.</p>
          <p>Out of all the variables, barbarian spawn rate and people production were changed the most. This was
            because difficulty increased as barbarians spawn rate was raised and people production rate was dropped.
            Combination time for brick and cities mostly influenced the pacing of the game, but did have some impact on
            difficulty. </p>
          <p>Playtesters were extremely helpful in revealing what aspects of the game needed to be balanced. Our first
            round of playtesters had discovered that having a large amount of people to defend and mine resources made
            the game easy, so it clear that people production needed to remain high. However, the barbarians were too
            stressful for players when there aren&#39t enough people in the field. Their spawn rate was initially constant,
            spawning every 5 seconds, but raising the spawn rate would make the game too easy during the mid and late
            game.</p>
          <p>It became obvious that a constant spawn rate was not going to work, so a new system was implemented that
            decreased the spawn rate exponentially over time. This gave the player an easy environment in the beginning
            but then increased in difficulty over the course of the game. Furthermore, cities instantly became a clear
            necessity for the mid and late game since they produced people at a faster rate. </p>
          <h3>Spreadsheets</h3>
          <p>To better understand the relationships between all of our game objects, variables were tracked and measured
            in spreadsheets.</p>
          <p>Below is a chart that tracks brick production. The top set of values shows how many bricks are produced per
            minute if the player doesn&#39t use cities. Cities produce people at a faster rate, but take more time to
            create and have a higher resource cost. The bottom values show how many bricks can be made per minute if the
            player only uses cities. </p>
          <p>The amount of bricks produced per minute is determined by the amount of committed workers multiplied by a 1
            minute divided by the combined time of brick production and people production.</p>

          <p>The player is likely to lose if they don&#39t use cities as people production is too slow when combining
            people together, so they must plan to build cites in the long term. If the player can manage to build two
            cities, then they can win in under 1 minute and a half. This equation doesn&#39t take into account the time
            spent transporting Tileobjects or fighting barbarians since that would overly complicate the model. </p>
          <img src="pages/gamedesign/xenowonder/xenowonder_spreadsheet_01.png" alt="placeholder" width="100%" />
          <p>Here is a chart that tracks barbarian spawn rate. Since we didn&#39t expect the game to last for more than 3
            minutes, the rate of barbarians was tracked every 20 seconds. The spawn interval decreases exponentially,
            using the depreciation rate. As the spawn rate decreases, the amount of barbarians that the player must face
            rises. There is a minimum spawn interval so that the player is not swarmed in the event that the player
            plays longer than 3 minutes. </p>
          <img src="pages/gamedesign/xenowonder/xenowonder_spreadsheet_02.png" alt="placeholder" width="100%" />
          <img src="pages/gamedesign/xenowonder/xenowonder_spreadsheet_03.png" alt="placeholder" width="100%" />
          <p>After 1 minute, the player has to deal with a barbarian every 15 seconds. If the player hasn&#39t started the
            production of a city by this point, the pressure of the barbarians will begin to feel overwhelming.</p>

          <h2>Playtesting</h2>
          <p>
            Biggest take away from playtesting was the realization that no one knew how to play Xeno-Wonder. The
            combining mechanic was not obvious and players weren&#39;t experimenting with different combinations. It
            wasn&#39;t until the final week when the realization sank in but there so many other small details that
            needed to be addressed, that fixing such a fundamental problem seemed too exhausting. Of course, it was only
            after the game was released when all of the easy solutions came to mind.
          </p>
          <p>After the release, tile highlights were added to indicate to the player which TileObjects could be combined
            with the current held Tileobject. UI is likely the best approach for helping people understand how to play
            since it pairs abstract logic with a visual sign that is memorizable and more intuitive.</p>
          <img src="pages/gamedesign/xenowonder/xeno-wonder_015_0000.jpg" alt="placeholder" width="100%" />
          <p>A strategy guide was added to the store page, as well as, a list of all the combinations. Although people
            tend to not read the descriptions before jumping into a game, let alone, whole paragraphs, so this
            wasn&#39;t an effective way to help players understand the game.</p>

          </p>
          <p>Stragety Guide<br>
            New players can struggle with the difficulty of Xeno-Wonder. If you are having a hard time, we suggest that
            you build up your economy before trying to build the pyramid. Generate as much people as possible in
            beginning. Once you have about 5 or 6 people, combine a brick with a person to create a city, then combine a
            person with the city. Cities will generate people faster, so you'll have an easier time mining brick and
            defending against barbarians. Once you build your second city, start adding brick to the pyramid and beat
            the game!

          <h2>Was it fun?</h2>
          <p>
            After release on itch.io, the game received a positive reception, although there was some critiques. The
            biggest complaint was the slow speed of the UFO. Many people found the movement frustrating, especially when
            there are many resources to take care of. The game was generally hard for most people which may have
            diminished the fun factor. This is not say that games shouldn&#39t be hard, but rather the difficulty of the
            game should include a mixture of easy to hard experiences. Xeno-Wonder is difficult the moment it starts,
            and only gets more harder to play over time.
